      service_cataract_text1: 白內障是香港常見眼疾之一，初期幾乎沒有症狀，病情發展到中期常被誤以為只是眼睛老化現象。當發展到嚴重階段，患者看東西時會模糊不清，嚴重者甚至會完全失去視力。故此，及早發現，相當重要。
      service_cataract_text2: 患有白內障，視力變模糊，看事物時會有疊層、殘影的感覺。病患影響您的視野，更使您的生活變得十分不便？
      service_cataract_text3: Around 90% of the cataracts in Hong Kong are due to aging. The lens hardens and becomes less transparent.
      service_cataract_text4: 視力模糊是白內障的主要症狀，隨病情惡化，可能有更多症狀困擾您。
      service_cataract_text5: 如果您有一項或以上的症狀，請不用感到焦慮，可聯絡我們約見眼科專科醫生，以盡快獲得正確的診斷和適合您的治療方案。
      service_cataract_text6: As there are no medications that can restore clear eyesight from cloudy vision resulting from cataract, surgery is the treatment.
      service_cataract_text7: The mainstream of cataract surgery is phacoemulsification combined with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The surgery is performed through an incision less than 3 mm in diameter. The cloudy lens will then be emulsified into tiny fragments by ultrasound and sucked out. Finally, an intraocular lens will be implanted. The surgery only takes 10-20 minutes and most of them are performed under topical anaesthesia (by applying numbing eye drops). The incision normally seals without stitches.
      service_cataract_text8: 最新一代的微創超聲波乳化手術，可以提高治療的精準度。只需使用較低超聲波能量，將混濁晶體乳化分解並吸走，傷口小、恢復時間快、手術時間短，大大減低手術對角膜造成的傷害、傷口感染或併發症。
      service_cataract_text9:  Cataract surgeons could customized the IOL planning for their patients according to their visual needs.With the pre-operative assessment, patients can discuss with their ophthalmologists on the selection of IOL according to their ocular condition, vision needs and financial situation, etc. IOLs could be divided into three types,

      service_cataract_array_meet:
        cataract_array_meet_q1: Q：Do we need to wait until the cataract get mature？
        cataract_array_meet_a1_1: With the advancement of cataract surgery and IOL technology, modern cataract surgery is more effective. Patients can consider earlier cataract surgery as it is more difficult to be removed and the risk of complications will be higher if a cataract is more mature.
        cataract_array_meet_a1_2: Therefore, patients should consider cataract surgery when their works and daily lives are affected. But it is a totally different story in the old days when there was no intraocular lens for implantation after a cataract surgery. Patients had to wear thick glasses to compensate after the lens was removed. The worse thing is, if only one eye was operated, the huge difference between two eyes would make people feel bad. Therefore, people consider surgery only until the cataract was mature. Even the ophthalmologists would suggest patients to have their cataract removed when it became mature in the old days.
        cataract_array_meet_q2: Q：How long do IOLs last? Do they need to be replaced?
        cataract_array_meet_a2: IOLs are placed permanently in your eye and will not "wear out". IOLs need to be replaced only if IOLs shift out of its original position or it is damaged. There is a very small amount of patients who cannot adapt to the implanted IOLs (around 2% in multifocal IOLs and it is much less in that of monofocal IOLs).
        cataract_array_meet_q3: Q：Do I need to wear glasses after the surgery?
        cataract_array_meet_a3: IOLs are placed permanently in your eye and will not "wear out". IOLs need to be replaced only if IOLs shift out of its original position or it is damaged. There is a very small amount of patients who cannot adapt to the implanted IOLs (around 2% in multifocal IOLs and it is much less in that of monofocal IOLs).
        cataract_array_meet_q4: Q：Will I have painful feeling during the surgery?
        cataract_array_meet_a4: Cataract surgery is performed under topical anesthesia (by applying numbing eye drops). Patients are awake during the surgery, but usually they do not feel pain.
        cataract_array_meet_q5: Q：Does cataract surgery need to be done in hospital?
        cataract_array_meet_a5_1: Cataract surgery is a minimally invasive surgery which does not require general anaesthesia which only eye drops are needed in most cases. Therefore, cataract surgery does not have to be performed in hospital medically. Our international standard operating theatres, which equipped with advanced machines and technology for preoperative assessment and surgical procedures, ensure a safe and reliable cataract surgery.
        cataract_array_meet_a5_2: However, some patients may need general anaesthetic and be treated in the hospital. For further information on surgical planning, please ask your ophthalmologist for more details
        cataract_array_meet_q6: Q：When can I resume daily activities/ exercises after cataract surgery?
        cataract_array_meet_a6_1: Patients can resume light exercise such as tai chi, walking or hiking if no abnormalities are found in day 1 post-operative follow-up. However, contact sports such as boxing are not recommended for a period of time. Please consult your doctor for more details and here below are some examples,
        cataract_array_meet_a6_2: 'Walking: 24 hours after the surgery'
        cataract_array_meet_a6_3: 'Air travel: 24 hours after the surgery'
        cataract_array_meet_a6_4: 'Swimming: 1 week after the surgery to reduce the risk of infection'
        cataract_array_meet_a6_5: 'Other facial or dental treatments: at least 1 week after the surgery. For the safety reason, it is better to be 1 month after the surgery.'

      service_glaucoma_text1: Glaucoma is a progressive degeneration of the optic nerve. Optic nerve acts like a cable to help transmit visual signals from our eyes to the visual center in the brain. Patients with glaucoma may experience peripheral vision loss followed by a decrease in central vision; permanent visual loss may occur in serious cases. Since there are no symptoms in the early stages of glaucoma, many patients may be unaware that they have glaucoma until the disease has already progressed to a more advanced stage. Hence, chronic glaucoma is sometimes referred to as the "silent thief of sight".
      service_glaucoma_text2: Glaucoma is associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP). The anterior chamber which is in front of the eye is filled with clear liquid secreted by ciliary body (aqueous humor). Aqueous humor circulates in anterior chamber. If there is blockage of aqueous humor drainage, it can lead to increased intraocular pressure, and damage the optic nerve.
      service_glaucoma_text3: "People with high myopia and long-term use of steroid eye drops, or have a history of eye injury, have higher chances of glaucoma. Moreover, several groups of systemic diseases can be associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucomatous, such as: migraine, cardiovascular disease, Raynaud's syndrome, and low blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes."
      service_glaucoma_text4: "Different types of glaucoma cause different symptoms among patients. The following are the common symptoms of glaucoma:"
      service_glaucoma_text5: If you are experiencing the above symptoms, it is highly recommended to find an ophthalmologist for examination as soon as possible, otherwise the vision may deteriorate rapidly, and damage to optic nerve may also occur.
      service_glaucoma_text6: Chronic Glaucoma is a common form of glaucoma. The patient has no obvious symptoms in the early stage but may experience gradual visual loss when the condition becomes worse. As there are no noticeable symptoms, chronic glaucoma's patients may not be alerted, until there is narrowing of the vision field. However, they can have visual loss in the severe stage. Therefore, chronic glaucoma is known as the ＂silent thief of sight ", literally, cause damage to vision slowly without any sign.
      service_glaucoma_text7: It is an ophthalmological emergency. Acute glaucoma is caused by a rapid or sudden increase of pressure inside the eye. Blurred vision, seeing rainbows or halos, eye redness, eye pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting may affect the patient. If you have any of these signs, please seek urgent medical care immediately. There are combined treatments (oral medications, eyedrops, or surgery) to reduce the eye pressure as soon as possible to avoid damage to the optic nerve. The vision of the patient could be lost permanently if acute glaucoma is not treated in time.
      service_glaucoma_text8: It is an eye disease related to genetic components. The aqueous humor outflow is blocked due to abnormal prenatal development of the drainage pathway. One-third of cases develop glaucoma in the fetal period, this glaucoma can be detected from birth to 2-3 years of age (infantile glaucoma) and two-third of cases develop in childhood, typically after 2-3 years of age (juvenile glaucoma).
      service_glaucoma_text9: The damage caused by glaucoma is irreversible, therefore it should be treated early to prevent visual damage. The diagnosis of glaucoma in children can be challenging and the treatments are usually lifelong.
      service_glaucoma_text10: Primary Glaucoma is defined as isolated, idiopathic disease of the anterior chamber of the eye and the optic nerve. Abnormal angle of anterior chamber may lead to elevated intraocular pressure as the Schlemm canal is failed to circulate the aqueous humor.
      service_glaucoma_text11: It is a chronic eye disease, which may lead to irreversible visual dysfunction in the long term. Patients need to receive long-term treatment otherwise the vision field will become narrower and eventually lead to vision loss. Primary glaucoma may be inherited. If the patient has high myopia or has a family history of glaucoma, the risk of glaucoma increases.
      service_glaucoma_text12: Secondary glaucoma is associated with known predisposing events including developmental abnormalities, systemic diseases, drug therapy, or trauma, which result in elevation of the eye pressure and damage to the optic nerve affecting vision.
      service_glaucoma_text13: "Patients may have to take some examinations and tests for the diagnosis, including vision examination, visual field text, funduscopic examination, intraocular pressure measurement, etc. The medical history and family history of the patient will also be considered. Common examinations are:"
      service_glaucoma_text14: The goal of glaucoma therapy is to control pressure and slow down the deterioration. Eye drops are considered to be the first-line treatment.
      service_glaucoma_text15: "If the patient's condition could not be well controlled by medication, surgical treatments may be considered to facilitate the drainage of aqueous humor and lower down the pressure. Common surgical treatments are as follows:"
      service_glaucoma_meetArr:
        meetArr_title1: Q：Does glaucoma only affect the elderly? Young people have less risks?
        meetArr_agree1: "Glaucoma is a progressive degeneration of the optic nerve and is associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP). People over 40 are at higher risk of having glaucoma. However people who are younger have risk of glaucoma too. Risk factors for glaucoma include: high myopia, family history of glaucoma, diabetes, high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease, as well as a history of eye injury and long-term use of steroids."
        meetArr_title2: Q：Can glaucoma be cured?
        meetArr_agree2: The goal of glaucoma therapy is to control pressure and slow down the deterioration. Although there's no cure for glaucoma, early treatment could slow down or even stop the damage and protect your vision.
        meetArr_title3: Q：Do glaucoma patients have shining eyes?
        meetArr_agree3: The eyes of glaucoma patients would not shine or turn green. The main symptoms of glaucoma patients are eye pain, redness, and sudden blurred vision. Some patients may also have headaches, migraine, nausea or vomiting, and even peripheral vision loss.
        meetArr_title4: Q：Do the patients with glaucoma need to seek medical care if have no vision loss?
        meetArr_agree4: Glaucoma is usually asymptomatic in the early stage. It is probably in late stage if there are blurred vision and impaired visual field. One's vision can be permanently damaged by that time he/she seek medical care. Therefore, it is recommended that people at high risk of glaucoma should have regular eyes check. Acute onset glaucoma usually shows obvious symptoms, including eye pain, blurred vision, red eyes, headache, vomiting, and with increased intraocular pressure (IOP). One should seek medical advice immediately if acute onset of glaucoma is suspected.

        congenital_title2: Corneal Opacity
        congenital_text2: In the early stage, mild whitish opacities appear due to corneal epithelium and subepithelial edema. Corneal opacity will become more apparent when edema progresses. After the eye pressure is reduced, corneal transparency may recover but permanent corneal opacification may occur if the high eye pressure results in tears and scarring of the cornea inner layers.
        congenital_title3: Enlarged Cornea
        congenital_text3: As the internal eye pressure increases, the wall of the eyeball expands, the diameter of the cornea may increase (more than 12mm in extreme cases).

        kind_text1: Uveitis Glaucoma
        kind_detail1: Acute inflammation in the eye (uveitis) normally does not lead to elevated pressure. However, severe, or repeated inflammation, where the inflammatory proteins increase, will cause blockage in the trabecular meshwork. Chronic uveitis can recur repeatedly and lead to the formation of adhesions between the iris and lens (posterior synechia) or between the iris and drainage angle (peripheral anterior synechiae) further compromising the drainage pathways. Uveitis glaucoma can by acute, chronic, or acute exacerbation of chronic condition. The visual field or visual loss may not be severe after the uveitis, but such damages are irreversible. In order to minimize the risk of uveitis recurrence, cautions should be taken during follow-ups and each relapse episode must be well treated.
        kind_text2: Posner-Schlossman Syndrome
        kind_detail2: It commonly affects adults aged 20-50 years. It presents acutely with markedly elevated intraocular pressure and anterior chamber inflammation. Usually, one eye is affected in Posner-Schlossman Syndrome, but the disease has the tendance of recurrence. Symptoms may be mild, but sudden eye pressure elevation can happen which should be addressed immediately to prevent permanent optic nerve damage.
        kind_text3: Steroid-Induced Glaucoma
        kind_detail3: Elevated eye pressure can be caused by topical, oral, or inhaled steroids. Its clinical manifestations are similar as primary open-angle glaucoma. Patients who require long term steroids should talk to their doctor on prevention of secondary glaucoma during steroid treatment.
        kind_text4: Cataract Induced Glaucoma
        kind_detail4: The size of lens increases, and it swells as cataract develops. It may push the iris and cause narrow anterior chamber angle. In severe cases, the drainage pathways may be totally blocked and induce elevated pressure. The elderly with far-sightedness (shorter eyeballs) are at higher risk.
        kind_text5: Traumatic Hyphema
        kind_detail5_1: Blood in the anterior chamber may block the drainage pathway and therefore lead to pressure rise. Blood in the vitreous cavity may be degraded into red blood cells (ghost cell glaucoma), hemoglobulin (hemolytic glaucoma) and iron (hemosiderotic). These 3 components may cause blockage and damage at the trabecular meshwork and subsequent elevated pressure.
        kind_detail5_2: ''
        kind_text6: Angle Recession Glaucoma
        kind_detail6: In severe blunt trauma, the iris and ciliary body (structures forming the drainage) may be disrupted or torn. It may result in trabecular meshwork damage and may lead elevation in eye pressure (either an immediate effect or subsequent result of scarring). Thus, the pressure of angle recession patients should be checked regularly.
        kind_text7: Neovascular Glaucoma
        kind_detail7_1: Neovascular glaucoma is a type of secondary glaucoma where the angle of the eye is closed by “new blood vessels,” hence the name “neovascular.” The “angle” referred to here is the angle between the iris, and the cornea. Neovascular glaucoma typically develops in eyes in which there is severe retinal vein blockage or severe diabetic eye disease. The cause of this disease is complex. In neovascular glaucoma, there is a lack of oxygen or blood supply at the back of the eye which cause the new vessels form in the iris and the angle, and often they are leaky or cause inflammation. New blood vessels growing over the drainage angle can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This process results in elevated eye pressure.
        kind_detail7_2: ''
        kind_text8: Ciliary Block Glaucoma
        kind_detail8: It is a rare surgical complication occurring in patients with pre-existing glaucoma, also known as malignant glaucoma. Misdirected aqueous fluid causes forward movement of the lens/iris diaphragm, shallowing the central and peripheral anterior chamber. This results in a highly elevated pressure like angle-closure glaucoma. If sudden eye pain, redness, blurring, headache, nausea, and vomiting is noted after any eye surgery or laser, one should seek urgent medical consultation.

        name: What are eye floaters?
        context: Eye floaters are also known as vitreous opacities. The vitreous shrinks as we age, becomes liquified and gradually forms different shapes of dark spots or shadows floating in the field of vision. They can look like raindrops, circles, clouds, cobwebs, amoebas, spiders or mosquitoes and may "fly" around at the front. They become apparent especially when you look at something bright or on monocolour background.

        name: CAUSES
        title1: Age-related Degeneration
        text1: Most eye floaters are caused by age-related changes. The vitreous becomes liquefied and shrinks as age, gradually occurring as the jelly-like substance (vitreous) inside your eyes becomes more liquid. These jelly-like substances will project as many small black dots on the retina, which will become the floaters.
        title2: Eye Injuries, Inflammation inside your eye
        text2: Floaters may result as particles and impurities in the gel-like substance after eye injuries or inflammation inside the eyes.
        title3: Intraocular Hemorrhage
        text3: Diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, eye stroke and other diseases can cause intraocular hemorrhage and floaters. It’s advised to seek medical treatment immediately if you are suffering from these diseases.
        title4: Retinal Disease

        context: "Most of the floaters are benign which is also called physiological floaters. They are basically harmless and can be classified into two types:"
        text1: Before a baby is born, there are lots of blood vessels that contain blood cells in the vitreous. These blood vessels are usually absorbed naturally before baby birth. However, if they are not completely absorbed, some blood vessels will remain in the vitreous and floaters will appear.
        text2: As we age, the vitreous gel degenerates gradually and shrinks with liquefaction. During liquefaction, some vitreous fibers become floaters in strands, threads, squiggly lines or transparent colorless shapes which float in the vitreous. These conditions usually appear among elderly and people with high myopia, who will develop eye floaters at an earlier age.
        name2: Malignant Floaters
        context1: Malignant floaters can be a warning of some serious eye diseases (e.g. posterior vitreous detachment, retinal degeneration and tears, diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration, etc.) which will lead to vitreous hemorrhage and uveitis. This type of floaters should be examined and treat (if needed) as early as possible.

        context: For benign eye floaters without complications, it is generally not treated but just observed. However, it is necessary to consider treatment in the cases that some patients cannot tolerate the symptoms of floaters or even in serious cases that visual function is being affected and impacting their lives. The current treatments mainly include laser therapy and Pars Plana Vitrectomy. The latter one has become more common to treat apparent eye floaters as it is less risky and has better results.
        name1: Laser Therapy
        context1: This treatment aims to treat large or central floaters in order to improve symptoms. The procedure takes around 15 to 20 minutes and can be performed under localized anesthesia. However, it is not fit for those whose floaters are not centralized, or they are too close to the macula or lens. In these cases, the therapy cannot be performed so as to prevent complications such as cataract or macular damage.
        name2_1: ""
        name2_2: Pars Plana Vitrectomy (Partial)
        context2_1: This treatment can be used for severe vitreous opacities. The process lasts for around 10 to 15 minutes. It is a minimally invasive surgery without stitches and the recovery time is short. The treatment requires topical anesthesia. Two incisions are made at the sclera, also known as the white part of the eye, one of them is for cutting, another one is for infusion of saline water. The patient can see floaters during the surgery and therefore the surgeon can communicate with the patient spontaneously in order to ensure vitreous opacities are cleared.
        context2_2: This technique can remove opacification in vitreous chamber. This surgery can be performed together with cataract treatment which replace opaque lens and remove vitreous opacity at the same time. Therefore, visual quality might be further improved after the surgery.
        p1: Small incisions, stitches are not required, short operation time and fast recovery.

        name: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
        q1: Q：When is the time to see an ophthalmologist for floaters?
        a1: Most of floaters are benign and basically harmless to the eyes. However, if it seriously affects daily life, or if you notice a sudden increase in floaters, loss of peripheral vision, or other uncommon or unusual symptoms such as eye pain, it’s suggested to see an eye doctor for further eye check.
        q2: Q：What should I do if there are a sudden increase in floaters?
        a2: If the floaters suddenly increase with flashes of bright lights, and/or loss of peripheral vision, blurred vision, etc., it can be a sign of severe eye disease. It is highly recommended to seek medical advice as soon as possible.
        q3: Q：Do eye drops and medications help get rid of floaters?
        a3: Anti-inflammatory eye drops may be used for treating pathological floaters; however, eye drops may not be useful for degenerative floaters which are not related to inflammation.

        name: What is conjunctivitis?
        context: Conjunctivitis known as "pink eye", is an inflammation or infection of the semi-transparent membrane (conjunctiva) that lines your eyelid and covers the white part of your eyeball. The semi-transparent layer will turn to pink or red when there is conjunctivitis. This condition is commonly caused by viruses or bacteria. Allergic reactions can also cause conjunctivitis. Anyone can get conjunctivitis, especially children.

        title1: Viral conjunctivitis
        text1: It is usually related to upper respiratory tract infection and caused by viruses. The main pathogens are adenovirus and enterovirus. This type of conjunctivitis is highly contagious, but the infected eye(s) usually recovers without treatment within a few days.
        title2: Bacterial conjunctivitis
        text2: It is caused by a variety of bacteria, the most common are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Both new-born babies and adults can be infected by Chlamydia. If bacterial conjunctivitis is not treated, the bacteria can cause serious damage to the eyes.
        title3: Allergic conjunctivitis
        text3: Allergic conjunctivitis is a common eye disease. When the allergens lead to inflamed eyes, microorganisms and environmental irritants, the immune system will overreact in responding to the allergens, causing the swollen blood vessels walls in conjunctiva and therefore the eyes become pink or red.

          context: "The following are common types of allergic conjunctivitis:"
          caption1: "- Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis"
          content1: "It usually occurs in spring and summer. The common allergens are mold spores, and plant pollen in the alternation of spring and summer. People with allergies, such as: asthma, allergic rhinitis, are more likely to suffer from seasonal allergic conjunctivitis."
          caption2: "- Perennial allergic conjunctivitis"
          content2: Allergens mainly are air pollutants, dust, dust mites or animal dander, etc. Allergic symptoms may occur in the whole year; however, the symptoms are mostly mild.
          caption3: "- Giant papillary conjunctivitis"
          content3: Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) is the most common complication of long-term use of contact lenses. A long-term wearing of contact lenses can cause roughness of the conjunctiva, so if contact lenses are not properly selected, examined, worn, or cared for, complications and sequelae will occur.
      approach:

        name: What is macular degeneration?
        context: The macula is the central portion of the retina where 90% of photoreceptors locate in this area. It is responsible for central vision of the eye, the ability to see fine details and to recognize colours, so it is important to keep your macula healthy in order to see clearly. Any damage to the macula is called Maculopathy. Symptoms of macular damage are decreased visual acuity, distortions in the appearance of lines and darkening of the central vision.

        name2: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
        context: The major cause of vision loss in AMD is the degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelial cells and the subsequent photoreceptor cell damage. Some patients have abnormal blood vessels growth and / or leakage from abnormal blood vessels which severely affect the macula and resulting in a significantly impaired vision. The risk of AMD increases with age. AMD affects 1-2 out of 100 persons aged over 50.
        name3: There are Dry types and Wet types of macular degeneration.
        name4: Dry macular degeneration
        text1: In Hong Kong, 90% of macular degeneration patients are dry type. There is degeneration of retinal pigment epithelial cells in the macular area and formation of accumulated metabolic waste. These form drusen (yellow deposits) under the retina, which eventually leads to atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium.
        text2: Most patients have no obvious symptoms in the early stage. As more photoreceptor cells are being damaged, one's vision gradually gets blurred. However, there is a chance that dry macular degeneration can become wet macular degeneration, which can lead to sudden and severe vision loss. Up to now, there is no cure for dry macular degeneration. Regular follow-up of the disease is required early intervention when needed.
        name5: Wet macular degeneration
        text3: There are 10% of macular degenerations are wet AMD. Patients have abnormal blood vessels under the macula. If these blood vessels have leakage (fluid or blood), they can cause subretinal bleeding and subsequent scarring, which cause permanent damage to the retina.
        text4: The deterioration of wet AMD can be rapid, and it can lead to central visual field defect. If one of the eyes experiences sudden blurred or distorted vision, wet AMD would be suspected. On the other hand, the fellow eye is also needed to be checked because it may be in the early stage of wet macular degeneration or may carry the risk of suffering from the disease. Wet AMD can lead to severe visual loss in a short period of time, can be a few days. Therefore, you should contact an ophthalmologist immediately when suspected symptoms happen.

        title1: Laser photocoagulation
        text1: Laser photocoagulation uses high-energy laser to destroy area with abnormal blood vessels of the retina. However, the laser would also cause damage to the retinal tissue above the vessels (this will lead to immediate vision impairment or blindness) and thus cannot be applied to the lesions which are close to the center of the macula. It is therefore only suitable for specific type of AMD patients and is not commonly used to treat AMD in clinical practice.
        title2: Photodynamic therapy
        text2: Doctor injects a dye called Verteporfin into the vein and the medicine will circulate to the abnormal blood vessels under the retina and then accumulate in the specific area. A special laser is then shone onto the area after saturated, the laser activates the Verteporfin and lead to blockage of the abnormal blood vessels without affecting other surrounding tissues in the retina. By blocking the leaky blood vessels, photodynamic therapy helps to improve macular edema or subretinal hemorrhage and hope to improve vision. It is proved to be a effective method to treat Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV) which regards to be a special subtype of wet AMD. However, this therapy cannot restore destroyed vision function.
        title3: Intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide "IV TA" injection
        text3: Triamcinolone acetonide is a mineralocorticoid that can reduce the swelling and leakage of blood vessels at the macula and thus reduce edema. IV TA is commonly given along with other Anti-VEGF drugs in some cases. Intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide "IV TA" injections are given under topical anaesthesia in a sterile setting.
        title4: Intravitreal Anti-VEGF Injection
        text4: In recent years, intravitreal Anti-VEGF injection becomes the mainstream treatment of wet AMD. Studies have shown that these injections can effectively prevent further vision loss and can even promote visual function improvement. Two most common drugs are Bevacizumab (Avastin®) and Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) which have proven to have similar therapeutic effect. Lucentis® is approved by FDA, Avastin® is used as off-label drugs. This treatment may need to be repeated monthly for long term desired effect. Aflibercept (Eylea®) is a newer drug which has proven to be equally effective with longer intervals between injections for wet AMD. The three anti-VEGF agents are reported to have similar treatment effect for wet AMD. In clinical practice, some patients may show tolerance to one of them, but show good efficacy if using another one.

        name: FAQ
        q1: Q：Will phone in the dark increase the risk of macular degeneration?
        a1: Prolonged blue light exposure is reported to be harmful to the macula. Our pupil will be more dilated in dark and therefore theoretically we may intake more blue light from the screens in the dark. Some studies have shown that prolonged exposure to high-energy visible light can cause damage to the macula, which is similar to macular degeneration.
        q2: Q：Older people are more likely to have macular degeneration?
        a2: The older you are, the higher risk of developing age-related macular degeneration you have. However, these are other risk factors we also need to pay attention to, such as smoking, eating lots of high saturated fat or cholesterol food, excessive sun exposure, having vascular disease or high blood pressure, already having macular degeneration in one eye or genetic factors.
        q3: Q：What's the difference between dry and wet macular degeneration?
        a3: Patients suffering from dry macular degeneration have no obvious symptoms in the early stage and deterioration in vision is relatively slow. Drusen or geographic atrophy can be seen in the patient's fundus. But it may develop into wet subtype during its natural disease course. Wet AMD tends to be more severe in term of the visual damage. It has abnormal growth of vessels which lead to leakage beneath macula and the leakage may affect vision significantly. Exudation, edema, or hemorrhage can be seen during eye examination. If wet macular degeneration is not treated properly, photoreceptor cells can be damaged and permanent loss of center vision can be caused.
        q4: Q：Can injections treat macular degeneration?
        a4: Yes, injection of drugs (anti-VFGF or steroids, etc.) into the vitreous cavity is one of the effective treatments for macular degeneration. Medical reports show that this method has a good efficacy on treating the macular edema caused by wet AMD and it also has a role to promote visual improvement. Timely treatment is important, the earlier the macular degeneration is treated, the better result one may have. Injection of medicine can also be given along with PDT or other treatment (named as combined treatment in clinical practice) to obtain better treatment outcomes. For further details, you should discuss with your eye doctor so as to come up with a tailor-made treatment regimen for you.

      strabismus:
        name: What is strabismus?
        p1: When a distant object is viewed with both eyes, the visual axes—a line connecting the center of the cornea with the fovea—are parallel or almost so, and each fovea receives an image of the object. Strabismus is misalignment of the eyes, causing one eye to deviate inward (esotropia) toward the nose, or outward (exotropia), while the other eye remains focused. Strabismus leads to deviation of the affected eye from the normal visual axis frequently, our brain may suppress the image of the affected eye which results in poor vision development and amblyopia in the affected eye.
        p2: "What causes strabismus? Congenital diseases like: congenital diseases of brain and cranial nerves; or acquired disease: eyes or eye muscles injury; or severe refractive error (e.g. farsightedness) can cause strabismus in children."
      kind: 
        name: Types of Strabismus
        name1: Inwards/Outwards squint
        context1: Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned. Esotropia means that one eye is deviated inward. Exotropia is when one or both eyes look outward.

        name3: How to determine if a child is a true and false strabismus?
        context3: Strabismus can be false. "False" strabismus refers to a condition where one or both eyes appear misaligned but really, they are straight. Infants and young children are more likely to have "false" strabismus (commonly known as "false crossed-eyes").
        text3_1: Normal
        text3_2: False strabismus
        text3_3: True strabismus
        context4: This condition is often due to the fact that babies have a broad flat nasal bridge with small folds of eyelid skin at the inner corner of the eyelids.  These features make the eyes look crossed when in fact they are not. This will lead to a false appearance of strabismus. However, when the fold of skin near to the nose bridge is pinched with fingers, the optical illusion will disappear. As the child grows up, the false strabismus gradually disappears.

        title1: Correction with glasses
        text1: Mild strabismus can be corrected by glasses. Many patients with strabismus also have refractive error which includes myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism. People with hyperopia are more susceptible to develop esotropia while people with myopia are more susceptible to develop exotropia. For some patients with esotropia, the glasses may be able to provide full correction of the inward squint.
        title2: Orthoptic exercises
        text2: There are many types of orthoptic exercises. Patients with exotropia can do convergence exercise while esotropia can do exercise to relax the eye muscles. Orthoptic exercise can train the binocular vision in order to help patients with strabismus to rebuild their fusional ability and also improve their '3D' vision (stereopsis).
        title3: Occlusion therapy
        text3: Since many patients with strabismus also have amblyopia, they need to adopt occlusion therapy to patch the eye that has better vision in order to force the amblyopic eye to watch and to improve its visual function. Sometimes, even in the absence of amblyopia, alternate patching might help some patients with intermittent exotropia to improve the ability to control their squint. The time of daily occlusion and the duration of treatment depends on the age of the patient and the severity of amblyopia. When the vision of the lazy eye improves, occlusion treatment can be stopped under the advice of an ophthalmologist.
        title4: Surgery
        text4: Surgery is generally the last step in the treatment of strabismus. By changing the tightness of the eye muscles, the visual axis of both eyes can be restored to be balanced, so as to treat strabismus. The timing of surgery involves many considerations and varies from different patients. Patients should consult an ophthalmologist before undergoing surgery.
      amblyopia:
        name: What is Amblyopia?
        context1: Amblyopia is reduced vision in one eye caused by abnormal visual development early in life. Babies' vision is not normal at birth, visual functions develop gradually in their childhood. The first 3 years after birth is the most important period for visual development. If amblyopia is not treated promptly, patients would not be able to develop normal vision, their vision cannot be corrected by glasses or surgery.

        text1: Strabismic amblyopia is commonly seen in children under 4 years old who have or have had strabismus before. The patient's eyes are misaligned and their brain will suppress the images from the affected eye and lead to amblyopia.
        title2: Refractive amblyopia(Anisometric amblyopia)
        text2: There is a significant difference of refraction between two eyes and therefore the size and clarity of retinal images are different. Patient with a diopter difference of more than 300 degrees between two eyes may have amblyopia and strabismus in the eye with higher diopter.
        title3: Amblyopia due to refractive error
        text3: It is commonly found in children or adults with high myopia, farsightedness and astigmatism without corrective glasses. Most of them have myopia of more than 600 degrees, farsightedness of more than 500 degrees, and astigmatism greater than or equal to 200 degrees.
        title4: Deprivation amblyopia
        text4: Ptosis, corneal opacity, and congenital cataract will block the light entering the eyes, so that the light cannot stimulate the eyeball, hinder or block the macula from receiving visual stimulation, resulting in amblyopia.
        title5: Congenital amblyopia
        text5: The cause of this eye condition is still unclear. It may be caused by retinal hemorrhage or optic nerve defects. The development of the visual function is affected. Some cases develop amblyopia because of nystagmus and achromatopsia. 
      treat: 
        name: Treatment of amblyopia
        p1: The earlier amblyopia is treated, the better outcomes there may be. Three to six years of age is a critical period for treatment, and the chance of cure is lower after 12 years of age. The cure rate is up to 80% if treated before the age of 6, while it is only about 50% for patients who start treatment at 6-12 years of age.
        p2: Ophthalmologists need to customize a treatment plan for each child, and it needs to be adjusted according to the patient's progress.
        title1: Correction with glasses
        text1: Mild amblyopia can be corrected by glasses. A proper pair of glasses allow both eyes to see things together and improve binocular vision. To ensure the treatment is effective, the child should always wear the glasses.
        title2: Occlusion therapy (Eye Patching)
        text2_1: By patching the good eye, the amblyopic eye is forced to watch so as to improve its vision. The duration of the treatment depends on the severity of the amblyopia, age, and the cooperation between the child and the parent. During the treatment period, the child needs to have regular follow-up visits. An ophthalmologist will check the vision of the good eye and the amblyopic eye, and adjust the time of occlusion. If the treatment is effective, the time of patching eyes will be gradually reduced until the amblyopic eye develops normal vision.
        text2_2: Eye patching is effective in treating amblyopia and it was suggested to start before the 8. The earlier the treatment starts, the better the effect would be. If amblyopia is diagnosed at 8 years old or later, the chance of full recovery is lower.
        title3: Correction with eye drops
        text3: If children are not willing or able to cover their eyes, due to discomfort or sensitive skin. Eye drops to blur the near vision of the good eye will be recommended, thereby encouraging children to use more amblyopic eyes.
      curativeTime:
        name: Treat strabismus and amblyopia timely!
        context: Patients should arrange an eye examination for their children regularly to find out the cause of eye problems as soon as possible. The earlier detection and treatment, the better the effect. The effect of treatment also requires the cooperation of parents and children.
    amotioRetinae: Retinal Detachment
    amotioRetinae_con: 
      title: retinal detachment
      intro: 
        name: What is Retinal Detachment?
        p1: The retina is a transparent, thin layer (less than 0.5mm in thickness) of tissue that lines the back of the eye. The central portion of the retina is called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. The retina acts like the film of a camera, it receives light that enters the eye, converts the light into neural signals, and sends these signals through the optic nerve to the brain for visual recognition. It is a sophisticated and fragile tissue and it is responsible for detecting qualities such as color and light-intensity. The retina is structured of ten layers, including nine layers of nerve cells and photoreceptors, one pigmented layer. The first nine-layers are called neurosensory retina and the tenth layer is called retinal pigment epithelium. One side of the retina is attached with the vitreous and the other side with the choroid.
        p2: Due to the retina’s vital role in vision, damage to it can cause permanent blindness. Conditions such as retinal detachment, where the retina is abnormally detached from its usual position, can disturb the retina from receiving or processing light. Therefore, the brain cannot receive visual information, thus leads to blindness. 
        p3: Retinal detachment is a serious ophthalmic emergency
        p4: ",which generally refers to the separation of the neurosensory retina (NSR) from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The RPE provides nutrition and oxygen for the NSR. Once the NSR is detached from the RPE, there can be significant loss of photoreceptor cells of the NSR that lead to visual damage, which may be irreversible."

        name: Treatments
        title1: Pneumatic retinopexy
        text1: An expanding gas bubble is injected into the eye, your doctor will position you so that the bubble floats over the detached area and pushes it against the back of your eye. Additional cryosurgery or laser therapy to seal the retina against the wall of the eye may also be needed.
        title2: Scleral buckle
        text2: Scleral buckling is a surgical procedure used to repair a retinal detachment. The scleral is the outer supporting layer of the eyeball. In this surgery, a surgeon attaches a piece of silicone or a sponge onto the outer part of the eye at the spot of a retinal tear/detachment, repairing the detachment by pushing the sclera toward the retinal tear or break. This is a surgery involving the outer part of the eye and therefore the risk of intraocular infection is considered to be less.
        title3: Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV)
        text3: Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is a minimally invasive procedure done with special tools inserted through three incisions (less than 1mm) the pars plana, an area in the white of the eye (sclera), to remove vitreous humor and re-attach the retina by injecting expanding gas or silicon oil. Other treatments (when needed) will be done at the same time, such as laser, membrane peeling or injection of anti-VFGF etc.
      diabetes:
        name: Diabetic Retinopathy
        p1: Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the retina (high blood sugar damages the endothelial cells of blood vessels). It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. Although it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten the eyesight, regular eye check is necessary for diabetic patients due to lack of symptom(s) in the early stage. Basically, all type 1 diabetes patients are affected by retinopathy in about 15 to 20 years after the onset of the disease. About 2-30% of type 1 diabetes patients are under the risk of vision loss while more than 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes have retinopathy in their disease course.
        p2: The retina is the light-sensitive layer that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain which turns them into the images we see. The retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels. Over time, a persistently high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels and retina, this damage can be permanent if not treated timely. Diabetic retinopathy includes blot hemorrhages, microaneurysms, hard exudates, diabetic macular edema, abnormal blood vessel growth in retina, retinal detachment, or secondary glaucoma. Permanent visual damage or even blindness can happen in severe cases.

        name: Prevention
        context: "Literally, one can’t prevent retinal detachment, but one can take steps to lower the risks:"
        title1: Regular Eye Check
        text1: If you have nearsightedness (myopia, especially high myopia), eye exams are important. Myopia makes you more prone to retinal detachment. Your eye care provider should include dilated exams to find small retinal tears.
        title2: Stay Safe
        text2: Use safety goggles or other protection for your eyes when playing sports or doing other risky activities (e.g. roller coasters, bumper cars, diving, skydiving, bungee jumping).
        title3: Get Prompt Treatment
        text3: If you notice detached retina symptoms (seeing a lot of floaters and flashes suddenly), consult your eye doctor right away for a comprehensive eye examination.
        span1: Any age can experience retinal detachment, and people at high risk should undergo regular comprehensive eye examinations.
        span2: If you see a lot of floaters and flashes suddenly, you should go to your eye doctor immediately.
      faq: 
        name: FAQ
        q1: Q：Do floaters cause retinal detachment?
        a1: The vitreous shrinks as we age, becomes liquified and gradually forms different shapes of dark spots or shadows floating in the field of vision, just like the mosquitoes are flying in front of our eyes. If there is a sudden onset of increased floaters, please go see your eye doctor, it is probably the signs of retinal detachment.
        q2: Q：Does rubbing eyes lead to retinal detachment?
        a2: The force introduced to the eye when rubbing could be dangerous to those with high myopia which might cause retinal break or tear in them. The eyeball of a high myopia patient is elongated and the retina is very thin which may have pre-existed some degeneration and make them at risk of retinal detachment.
        q3: Q：Does retinal detachment need surgery for treatment?
        a3: "Retinal detachment is a visual-threatening emergency that requires prompt treatment. Treatments mainly include laser or surgery: if the retinal detachment is small and located peripherally, lasers can help to repair; if the retinal detachment is large in size, surgery might be the only option."
        q4: Q：Will retinal detachment recur?
        a4: "Retinal detachment has the risk of recurrence. Patients with a previous history of eye injury and diabetes have higher risks. It is recommended that a high-risk person should develop good eye health, such as: do not look at electronic screens or read at a close distance for a long time; use electronic products in sufficient light environments; have enough rest and have regular eye check."
