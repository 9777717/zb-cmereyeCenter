      service_cataract_btn7: Which type of IOL is suitable for you?
      service_cataract_text1: Cataract is one of the common eye disorders in Hong Kong. In the early stages, there are almost no symptoms, and the condition is often mistaken for normal age-related changes in the eyes. As the condition progresses to the intermediate stage, patients may experience blurry vision, and in severe cases, they may even lose their vision completely. Therefore, early detection is crucial.
      service_cataract_text2: Having cataracts can cause blurry vision, double vision, and a sense of overlapping or ghosting when looking at objects. Does the condition affect your field of vision and significantly inconvenience your daily life?
      service_cataract_text3: Around 90% of the cataracts in Hong Kong are due to aging. The lens hardens and becomes less transparent.
      service_cataract_text4: Blurred vision is the primary symptom of cataracts. As the condition progresses, you may experience additional symptoms that can be bothersome.
      service_cataract_text5: If you have one or more of these symptoms. You can contact us to schedule an appointment with a specialized ophthalmologist to receive a proper diagnosis and discuss suitable treatment options as soon as possible.
      service_cataract_text6: As there are no medications that can restore clear eyesight from cloudy vision resulting from cataract, surgery is the treatment.
      service_cataract_text7: The mainstream of cataract surgery is phacoemulsification combined with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The surgery is performed through an incision less than 3 mm in diameter. The cloudy lens will then be emulsified into tiny fragments by ultrasound and sucked out. Finally, an intraocular lens will be implanted. The surgery only takes 10-20 minutes and most of them are performed under topical anaesthesia (by applying numbing eye drops). The incision normally seals without stitches.
      service_cataract_text8: The latest generation of minimally invasive phacoemulsification surgery improves the precision of treatment. By using lower levels of energy, the cloudy lens is emulsified and removed through a small incision, resulting in minimal wound size, faster recovery time, and shorter surgical duration. This significantly reduces the risk of corneal damage, wound infection, or complications associated with the surgery.
      service_cataract_text9:  Cataract surgeons could customized the IOL planning for their patients according to their visual needs.With the pre-operative assessment, patients can discuss with their ophthalmologists on the selection of IOL according to their ocular condition, vision needs and financial situation, etc. IOLs could be divided into three types,

      service_cataract_array_announcements:
        cataract_array_announcements1: To promote wound healing and prevent bacterial infection, it is recommended to keep the surgical dressing, gauze, and eye shield in place overnight after cataract surgery until the following day when they can be removed. If they accidentally become loose or dislodged, it is advisable to reapply the sterile gauze dressing to protect the eye and maintain proper hygiene. It's important to follow the post-operative instructions provided by your surgeon to ensure optimal recovery and minimize the risk of complications
        cataract_array_announcements2: It is recommended for patients to use a protective eye shield while sleeping for two weeks after surgery. This helps prevent unnecessary bumps or rubbing of the eyes.
        cataract_array_announcements3: It is not recommended to wash the hair after surgery (at the same day). It is important to avoid getting the dressing wet during shower. Typically, for the first week after surgery, it is advised to wash the hair while lying flat or with the head tilted back to prevent water from entering the eyes. Wearing protective eyewear, such as swim goggles, during hair washing can also provide additional protection.
        cataract_array_announcements4: It is important to keep the wound clean. It is recommended to use a cotton pad soaked in sterile water to clean eyelids. Start by cleaning the lower lid, move to the upper lid and clean the bottom lashes by wiping from the inner to the outer. This procedure is suggested to be done before applying eye drops, and four to six times a day.
        cataract_array_announcements5: Rubbing the eyes should be avoided. It is also advised to avoid lifting heavy objects or bending over. Vigorous exercises like running, diving, and contact sports should be avoided as well to minimize the risk of eye injury.
        cataract_array_announcements6: Follow the instructions provided and ensure to use the prescribed eye drops regularly as directed by your doctor. It is important to maintain a balanced diet as well to support overall health and aid in the healing process.
        cataract_array_announcements7: If you experience unexpected bleeding, discharge, severe pain, or sudden blurred vision after surgery, please seek medical attention as soon as possible. These symptoms could indicate a potential complication or infection, which may require early treatments.
      service_cataract_array_meet:
        cataract_array_meet_q1: Q：Do we need to wait until the cataract get mature？
        cataract_array_meet_a1_1: With the advancement of cataract surgery and IOL technology, modern cataract surgery is more effective. Patients can consider earlier cataract surgery as it is more difficult to be removed and the risk of complications will be higher if a cataract is more mature.
        cataract_array_meet_a1_2: Therefore, patients should consider cataract surgery when their works and daily lives are affected. But it is a totally different story in the old days when there was no intraocular lens for implantation after a cataract surgery. Patients had to wear thick glasses to compensate after the lens was removed. The worse thing is, if only one eye was operated, the huge difference between two eyes would make people feel bad. Therefore, people consider surgery only until the cataract was mature. Even the ophthalmologists would suggest patients to have their cataract removed when it became mature in the old days.
        cataract_array_meet_q2: Q：How long do IOLs last? Do they need to be replaced?
        cataract_array_meet_a2: IOLs are placed permanently in your eye and will not "wear out". IOLs need to be replaced only if IOLs shift out of its original position or it is damaged. There is a very small amount of patients who cannot adapt to the implanted IOLs (around 2% in multifocal IOLs and it is much less in that of monofocal IOLs).
        cataract_array_meet_q3: Q：Do I need to wear glasses after the surgery?
        cataract_array_meet_a3: Your doctor will customize the target refraction according to your daily visual tasks and visual demands. Some of the patients may not need glasses after surgery if the target refractions fit their needs well. For those who require a better vision quality, they can be prescribed with glasses in order to assist them to gain a better vision for different purposes.
        cataract_array_meet_q4: Q：Will I have painful feeling during the surgery?
        cataract_array_meet_a4: Cataract surgery is performed under topical anesthesia (by applying numbing eye drops). Patients are awake during the surgery, but usually they do not feel pain.
        cataract_array_meet_q5: Q：Does cataract surgery need to be done in hospital?
        cataract_array_meet_a5_1: Cataract surgery is a minimally invasive surgery which does not require general anaesthesia which only eye drops are needed in most cases. Therefore, cataract surgery does not have to be performed in hospital medically. Our international standard operating theatres, which equipped with advanced machines and technology for preoperative assessment and surgical procedures, ensure a safe and reliable cataract surgery.
        cataract_array_meet_a5_2: However, some patients may need general anaesthetic and be treated in the hospital. For further information on surgical planning, please ask your ophthalmologist for more details
        cataract_array_meet_q6: Q：When can I resume daily activities/ exercises after cataract surgery?
        cataract_array_meet_a6_1: Patients can resume light exercise such as tai chi, walking or hiking if no abnormalities are found in day 1 post-operative follow-up. However, contact sports such as boxing are not recommended for a period of time. Please consult your doctor for more details and here below are some examples,
        cataract_array_meet_a6_2: 'Walking: 24 hours after the surgery'
        cataract_array_meet_a6_3: 'Air travel: 24 hours after the surgery'
        cataract_array_meet_a6_4: 'Swimming: 1 week after the surgery to reduce the risk of infection'
        cataract_array_meet_a6_5: 'Other facial or dental treatments: at least 1 week after the surgery. For the safety reason, it is better to be 1 month after the surgery.'

      service_glaucoma_text1: Glaucoma is a progressive degeneration of the optic nerve. Optic nerve acts like a cable to help transmit visual signals from our eyes to the visual center in the brain. Patients with glaucoma may experience peripheral vision loss followed by a decrease in central vision; permanent visual loss may occur in serious cases. Since there are no symptoms in the early stages of glaucoma, many patients may be unaware that they have glaucoma until the disease has already progressed to a more advanced stage. Hence, chronic glaucoma is sometimes referred to as the "silent thief of sight".
      service_glaucoma_text2: Glaucoma is associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP). The anterior chamber which is in front of the eye is filled with clear liquid secreted by ciliary body (aqueous humor). Aqueous humor circulates in anterior chamber. If there is blockage of aqueous humor drainage, it can lead to increased intraocular pressure, and damage the optic nerve.
      service_glaucoma_text3: "People with high myopia and long-term use of steroid eye drops, or have a history of eye injury, have higher chances of glaucoma. Moreover, several groups of systemic diseases can be associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucomatous, such as: migraine, cardiovascular disease, Raynaud's syndrome, and low blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes."
      service_glaucoma_text4: "Different types of glaucoma cause different symptoms among patients. The following are the common symptoms of glaucoma:"
      service_glaucoma_text5: If you are experiencing the above symptoms, it is highly recommended to find an ophthalmologist for examination as soon as possible, otherwise the vision may deteriorate rapidly, and damage to optic nerve may also occur.
      service_glaucoma_text6: Chronic Glaucoma is a common form of glaucoma. The patient has no obvious symptoms in the early stage but may experience gradual visual loss when the condition becomes worse. As there are no noticeable symptoms, chronic glaucoma's patients may not be alerted, until there is narrowing of the vision field. However, they can have visual loss in the severe stage. Therefore, chronic glaucoma is known as the ＂silent thief of sight ", literally, cause damage to vision slowly without any sign.
      service_glaucoma_text7: It is an ophthalmological emergency. Acute glaucoma is caused by a rapid or sudden increase of pressure inside the eye. Blurred vision, seeing rainbows or halos, eye redness, eye pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting may affect the patient. If you have any of these signs, please seek urgent medical care immediately. There are combined treatments (oral medications, eyedrops, or surgery) to reduce the eye pressure as soon as possible to avoid damage to the optic nerve. The vision of the patient could be lost permanently if acute glaucoma is not treated in time.
      service_glaucoma_text8: It is an eye disease related to genetic components. The aqueous humor outflow is blocked due to abnormal prenatal development of the drainage pathway. One-third of cases develop glaucoma in the fetal period, this glaucoma can be detected from birth to 2-3 years of age (infantile glaucoma) and two-third of cases develop in childhood, typically after 2-3 years of age (juvenile glaucoma).
      service_glaucoma_text9: The damage caused by glaucoma is irreversible, therefore it should be treated early to prevent visual damage. The diagnosis of glaucoma in children can be challenging and the treatments are usually lifelong.
      service_glaucoma_text10: Primary Glaucoma is defined as isolated, idiopathic disease of the anterior chamber of the eye and the optic nerve. Abnormal angle of anterior chamber may lead to elevated intraocular pressure as the Schlemm canal is failed to circulate the aqueous humor.
      service_glaucoma_text11: It is a chronic eye disease, which may lead to irreversible visual dysfunction in the long term. Patients need to receive long-term treatment otherwise the vision field will become narrower and eventually lead to vision loss. Primary glaucoma may be inherited. If the patient has high myopia or has a family history of glaucoma, the risk of glaucoma increases.
      service_glaucoma_text12: Secondary glaucoma is associated with known predisposing events including developmental abnormalities, systemic diseases, drug therapy, or trauma, which result in elevation of the eye pressure and damage to the optic nerve affecting vision.
      service_glaucoma_text13: "Patients may have to take some examinations and tests for the diagnosis, including vision examination, visual field text, funduscopic examination, intraocular pressure measurement, etc. The medical history and family history of the patient will also be considered. Common examinations are:"
      service_glaucoma_text14: The goal of glaucoma therapy is to control pressure and slow down the deterioration. Eye drops are considered to be the first-line treatment.
      service_glaucoma_text15: "If the patient's condition could not be well controlled by medication, surgical treatments may be considered to facilitate the drainage of aqueous humor and lower down the pressure. Common surgical treatments are as follows:"
      service_glaucoma_meetArr:
        meetArr_title1: Q：Does glaucoma only affect the elderly? Young people have less risks?
        meetArr_agree1: "Glaucoma is a progressive degeneration of the optic nerve and is associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP). People over 40 are at higher risk of having glaucoma. However people who are younger have risk of glaucoma too. Risk factors for glaucoma include: high myopia, family history of glaucoma, diabetes, high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease, as well as a history of eye injury and long-term use of steroids."
        meetArr_title2: Q：Can glaucoma be cured?
        meetArr_agree2: The goal of glaucoma therapy is to control pressure and slow down the deterioration. Although there's no cure for glaucoma, early treatment could slow down or even stop the damage and protect your vision.
        meetArr_title3: Q：Do glaucoma patients have shining eyes?
        meetArr_agree3: The eyes of glaucoma patients would not shine or turn green. The main symptoms of glaucoma patients are eye pain, redness, and sudden blurred vision. Some patients may also have headaches, migraine, nausea or vomiting, and even peripheral vision loss.
        meetArr_title4: Q：Do the patients with glaucoma need to seek medical care if have no vision loss?
        meetArr_agree4: Glaucoma is usually asymptomatic in the early stage. It is probably in late stage if there are blurred vision and impaired visual field. One's vision can be permanently damaged by that time he/she seek medical care. Therefore, it is recommended that people at high risk of glaucoma should have regular eyes check. Acute onset glaucoma usually shows obvious symptoms, including eye pain, blurred vision, red eyes, headache, vomiting, and with increased intraocular pressure (IOP). One should seek medical advice immediately if acute onset of glaucoma is suspected.

        congenital_title2: Corneal Opacity
        congenital_text2: In the early stage, mild whitish opacities appear due to corneal epithelium and subepithelial edema. Corneal opacity will become more apparent when edema progresses. After the eye pressure is reduced, corneal transparency may recover but permanent corneal opacification may occur if the high eye pressure results in tears and scarring of the cornea inner layers.
        congenital_title3: Enlarged Cornea
        congenital_text3: As the internal eye pressure increases, the wall of the eyeball expands, the diameter of the cornea may increase (more than 12mm in extreme cases).

        kind_text1: Uveitis Glaucoma
        kind_detail1: Acute inflammation in the eye (uveitis) normally does not lead to elevated pressure. However, severe, or repeated inflammation, where the inflammatory proteins increase, will cause blockage in the trabecular meshwork. Chronic uveitis can recur repeatedly and lead to the formation of adhesions between the iris and lens (posterior synechia) or between the iris and drainage angle (peripheral anterior synechiae) further compromising the drainage pathways. Uveitis glaucoma can by acute, chronic, or acute exacerbation of chronic condition. The visual field or visual loss may not be severe after the uveitis, but such damages are irreversible. In order to minimize the risk of uveitis recurrence, cautions should be taken during follow-ups and each relapse episode must be well treated.
        kind_text2: Posner-Schlossman Syndrome
        kind_detail2: It commonly affects adults aged 20-50 years. It presents acutely with markedly elevated intraocular pressure and anterior chamber inflammation. Usually, one eye is affected in Posner-Schlossman Syndrome, but the disease has the tendance of recurrence. Symptoms may be mild, but sudden eye pressure elevation can happen which should be addressed immediately to prevent permanent optic nerve damage.
        kind_text3: Steroid-Induced Glaucoma
        kind_detail3: Elevated eye pressure can be caused by topical, oral, or inhaled steroids. Its clinical manifestations are similar as primary open-angle glaucoma. Patients who require long term steroids should talk to their doctor on prevention of secondary glaucoma during steroid treatment.
        kind_text4: Cataract Induced Glaucoma
        kind_detail4: The size of lens increases, and it swells as cataract develops. It may push the iris and cause narrow anterior chamber angle. In severe cases, the drainage pathways may be totally blocked and induce elevated pressure. The elderly with far-sightedness (shorter eyeballs) are at higher risk.
        kind_text5: Traumatic Hyphema
        kind_detail5_1: Blood in the anterior chamber may block the drainage pathway and therefore lead to pressure rise. Blood in the vitreous cavity may be degraded into red blood cells (ghost cell glaucoma), hemoglobulin (hemolytic glaucoma) and iron (hemosiderotic). These 3 components may cause blockage and damage at the trabecular meshwork and subsequent elevated pressure.
        kind_detail5_2: ''
        kind_text6: Angle Recession Glaucoma
        kind_detail6: In severe blunt trauma, the iris and ciliary body (structures forming the drainage) may be disrupted or torn. It may result in trabecular meshwork damage and may lead elevation in eye pressure (either an immediate effect or subsequent result of scarring). Thus, the pressure of angle recession patients should be checked regularly.
        kind_text7: Neovascular Glaucoma
        kind_detail7_1: Neovascular glaucoma is a type of secondary glaucoma where the angle of the eye is closed by “new blood vessels,” hence the name “neovascular.” The “angle” referred to here is the angle between the iris, and the cornea. Neovascular glaucoma typically develops in eyes in which there is severe retinal vein blockage or severe diabetic eye disease. The cause of this disease is complex. In neovascular glaucoma, there is a lack of oxygen or blood supply at the back of the eye which cause the new vessels form in the iris and the angle, and often they are leaky or cause inflammation. New blood vessels growing over the drainage angle can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This process results in elevated eye pressure.
        kind_detail7_2: ''
        kind_text8: Ciliary Block Glaucoma
        kind_detail8: It is a rare surgical complication occurring in patients with pre-existing glaucoma, also known as malignant glaucoma. Misdirected aqueous fluid causes forward movement of the lens/iris diaphragm, shallowing the central and peripheral anterior chamber. This results in a highly elevated pressure like angle-closure glaucoma. If sudden eye pain, redness, blurring, headache, nausea, and vomiting is noted after any eye surgery or laser, one should seek urgent medical consultation.

        title1: Lipid layer
        text1: It is in the outermost of tear film, is secreted by the Meibomian glands of the eyelid. The main function is to increase the surface tension of the tear film, avoid the evaporation of the aqueous layer, and moisturize the eyelids and the surface of the eyeball.
        title2: Aqueous layer
        text2:  It is in the middle layer, secreted by the lacrimal gland. It moisturizes the surface of the eye, provides oxygen to the cornea, and has the function of sterilizing and removing metabolites.
        title3: Mucin layer
        text3: Produced by the goblet cells of conjunctiva, this layer is in the innermost layer. It makes the aqueous layer can be evenly distributed on the surface of the cornea and conjunctiva, reducing the friction generated when winking the eyes.

        title2: Evaporative dry eye
        text2: The meibomian glands are near the eyelashes, and their main function is to secrete lipid of the tear film onto the ocular surface. A healthy lipid layer can slow down the volatilization of the water component of the tear film. If the quality of the lipid layer is not good (due to eyelid diseases, i.e. "Meibomian gland dysfunction”), the water component of tears will evaporate quickly and cause dryness.

The ophthalmologist will need to apply additional tests (e.g.: a fluorescein eye stain test) to confirm the diagnosis of dry eyes. If the length is less than 5 mm and a fluorescein eye stain test is positive, the patient probably has already suffered from dry eyes."

        name: Treatments for Dry Eyes
        context: The treatments of dry eyes are to relieve the symptoms of dry eyes, increasing tears on the surface of eyeballs, increasing tear secretion and reducing tear evaporation. Dry eye is a chronic disease syndrome which requires long-term treatment. Patients’ living habits are also important for relieving the symptoms.

        context2_2: Applying artificial tear is also an efficient treatment for dry eyes, other than the approaches that target the underlying cause of this disease. With the continuous advancement of pharmaceutics, artificial tears have undergone improvements. In addition, there are many new medications that target the three-layered structure of tear film as a supplement therapy to treat dry eyes. This greatly improves the efficacy of dry eyes medication treatment.
        context2_3: "Lubricant for eyes is needed to be chosen on the market. Many eye drops contain preservatives for a longer-term storage. Normally, lubricants (i.e., artificial tears) that contain preservatives will not cause damage to the ocular surface. However, preservatives in eye drops have a higher risk of causing discomfort in dry eye patients, so they should use lubricants without preservatives to avoid discomfort such as eye allergy, etc. Generally, lubricants can be divided to eye drops and ointments:"
        title2_1: Eye drops
        text2_1: It is convenient and simple to use by directly drop on the surface of the eye. If the symptoms are serious, it may need to be used frequently.
        title2_2: Eye ointment
        text2_2: The artificial tears ointment has a high degree of adhesion so it can stay in the eyes for a longer time, keeping the eyes moist. However, they might be too sticky to cause short-term blurred vision. Therefore, it is recommended to use it when the eyes are resting (may use before going to bed).
        name1_3: Reduce tear loss
        context3: Use lacrimal plugs to block the drainage holes in the tear duct in order to reduce tear loss; patients with serious conditions can consider permanently closing their tear ducts.

        name: What are eye floaters?
        context: Eye floaters are also known as vitreous opacities. The vitreous shrinks as we age, becomes liquified and gradually forms different shapes of dark spots or shadows floating in the field of vision. They can look like raindrops, circles, clouds, cobwebs, amoebas, spiders or mosquitoes and may "fly" around at the front. They become apparent especially when you look at something bright or on monocolour background.

        name: CAUSES
        title1: Age-related Degeneration
        text1: Most eye floaters are caused by age-related changes. The vitreous becomes liquefied and shrinks as age, gradually occurring as the jelly-like substance (vitreous) inside your eyes becomes more liquid. These jelly-like substances will project as many small black dots on the retina, which will become the floaters.
        title2: Eye Injuries, Inflammation inside your eye
        text2: Floaters may result as particles and impurities in the gel-like substance after eye injuries or inflammation inside the eyes.
        title3: Intraocular Hemorrhage
        text3: Diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, eye stroke and other diseases can cause intraocular hemorrhage and floaters. It’s advised to seek medical treatment immediately if you are suffering from these diseases.
        title4: Retinal Disease
        text4: Presence of floaters might be a sign of retinal tear, retinal detachment, or degeneration. If the floaters are caused by retinal disease, you must seek medical help immediately, otherwise vision loss may occur in severe cases.

        name1: Benign Floaters
        context: "Most of the floaters are benign which is also called physiological floaters. They are basically harmless and can be classified into two types:"
        text1: Before a baby is born, there are lots of blood vessels that contain blood cells in the vitreous. These blood vessels are usually absorbed naturally before baby birth. However, if they are not completely absorbed, some blood vessels will remain in the vitreous and floaters will appear.
        text2: As we age, the vitreous gel degenerates gradually and shrinks with liquefaction. During liquefaction, some vitreous fibers become floaters in strands, threads, squiggly lines or transparent colorless shapes which float in the vitreous. These conditions usually appear among elderly and people with high myopia, who will develop eye floaters at an earlier age.
        name2: Malignant Floaters
        context1: Malignant floaters can be a warning of some serious eye diseases (e.g. posterior vitreous detachment, retinal degeneration and tears, diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration, etc.) which will lead to vitreous hemorrhage and uveitis. This type of floaters should be examined and treat (if needed) as early as possible.

        context: For benign eye floaters without complications, it is generally not treated but just observed. However, it is necessary to consider treatment in the cases that some patients cannot tolerate the symptoms of floaters or even in serious cases that visual function is being affected and impacting their lives. The current treatments mainly include laser therapy and Pars Plana Vitrectomy. The latter one has become more common to treat apparent eye floaters as it is less risky and has better results.
        name1: Laser Therapy
        context1: This treatment aims to treat large or central floaters in order to improve symptoms. The procedure takes around 15 to 20 minutes and can be performed under localized anesthesia. However, it is not fit for those whose floaters are not centralized, or they are too close to the macula or lens. In these cases, the therapy cannot be performed so as to prevent complications such as cataract or macular damage.
        name2_1: ""
        name2_2: Pars Plana Vitrectomy (Partial)
        context2_1: This treatment can be used for severe vitreous opacities. The process lasts for around 10 to 15 minutes. It is a minimally invasive surgery without stitches and the recovery time is short. The treatment requires topical anesthesia. Two incisions are made at the sclera, also known as the white part of the eye, one of them is for cutting, another one is for infusion of saline water. The patient can see floaters during the surgery and therefore the surgeon can communicate with the patient spontaneously in order to ensure vitreous opacities are cleared.
        context2_2: This technique can remove opacification in vitreous chamber. This surgery can be performed together with cataract treatment which replace opaque lens and remove vitreous opacity at the same time. Therefore, visual quality might be further improved after the surgery.

        name: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
        q1: Q：When is the time to see an ophthalmologist for floaters?
        a1: Most of floaters are benign and basically harmless to the eyes. However, if it seriously affects daily life, or if you notice a sudden increase in floaters, loss of peripheral vision, or other uncommon or unusual symptoms such as eye pain, it’s suggested to see an eye doctor for further eye check.
        q2: Q：What should I do if there are a sudden increase in floaters?
        a2: If the floaters suddenly increase with flashes of bright lights, and/or loss of peripheral vision, blurred vision, etc., it can be a sign of severe eye disease. It is highly recommended to seek medical advice as soon as possible.
        q3: Q：Do eye drops and medications help get rid of floaters?
        a3: Anti-inflammatory eye drops may be used for treating pathological floaters; however, eye drops may not be useful for degenerative floaters which are not related to inflammation.

        name: What is conjunctivitis?
        context: Conjunctivitis known as "pink eye", is an inflammation or infection of the semi-transparent membrane (conjunctiva) that lines your eyelid and covers the white part of your eyeball. The semi-transparent layer will turn to pink or red when there is conjunctivitis. This condition is commonly caused by viruses or bacteria. Allergic reactions can also cause conjunctivitis. Anyone can get conjunctivitis, especially children.

        title1: Viral conjunctivitis
        text1: It is usually related to upper respiratory tract infection and caused by viruses. The main pathogens are adenovirus and enterovirus. This type of conjunctivitis is highly contagious, but the infected eye(s) usually recovers without treatment within a few days.
        title2: Bacterial conjunctivitis
        text2: It is caused by a variety of bacteria, the most common are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Both new-born babies and adults can be infected by Chlamydia. If bacterial conjunctivitis is not treated, the bacteria can cause serious damage to the eyes.
        title3: Allergic conjunctivitis
        text3: Allergic conjunctivitis is a common eye disease. When the allergens lead to inflamed eyes, microorganisms and environmental irritants, the immune system will overreact in responding to the allergens, causing the swollen blood vessels walls in conjunctiva and therefore the eyes become pink or red.

          context: "The following are common types of allergic conjunctivitis:"
          caption1: "- Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis"
          content1: "It usually occurs in spring and summer. The common allergens are mold spores, and plant pollen in the alternation of spring and summer. People with allergies, such as: asthma, allergic rhinitis, are more likely to suffer from seasonal allergic conjunctivitis."
          caption2: "- Perennial allergic conjunctivitis"
          content2: Allergens mainly are air pollutants, dust, dust mites or animal dander, etc. Allergic symptoms may occur in the whole year; however, the symptoms are mostly mild.
          caption3: "- Giant papillary conjunctivitis"
          content3: Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) is the most common complication of long-term use of contact lenses. A long-term wearing of contact lenses can cause roughness of the conjunctiva, so if contact lenses are not properly selected, examined, worn, or cared for, complications and sequelae will occur.
      approach:
        name: Mode of transmission
        context: Conjunctivitis can be divided into infectious and non-infectious causes. Viral and bacterial are extremely infectious, can be infected by close contact with the patient or indirect contact with contaminated items.
        name1: "Common ways of transmission:"
        text1: Touching the infected individuals’eyes or upper respiratory tract secretions with hands.
        text2: "Sharing personal items, such as: towels, clothing, eye cosmetics or eye drops."
        text3: If swimmers swim in a contaminated pool, they could also be infected.
        context1: The incubation period is usually 1-12 days after exposure for bacterial conjunctivitis. It takes about 10 days to several weeks from the onset of symptoms until recovery.

        title2: Bacterial conjunctivitis
        text2: The bacterial conjunctivitis is usually treated with medications that to be prescribed by doctors, such as eye drops or ointments containing antibiotics.
        title3: Allergic conjunctivitis
        text3: If the conjunctivitis is caused by the allergens, avoiding contact with allergens can reduce symptoms or prevent relapse. Contact lenses should be stopped if they cause conjunctivitis. Clinically, the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis can also be relieved by medications.

        context: The macula is the central portion of the retina where 90% of photoreceptors locate in this area. It is responsible for central vision of the eye, the ability to see fine details and to recognize colours, so it is important to keep your macula healthy in order to see clearly. Any damage to the macula is called Maculopathy. Symptoms of macular damage are decreased visual acuity, distortions in the appearance of lines and darkening of the central vision.

        name2: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
        context: The major cause of vision loss in AMD is the degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelial cells and the subsequent photoreceptor cell damage. Some patients have abnormal blood vessels growth and / or leakage from abnormal blood vessels which severely affect the macula and resulting in a significantly impaired vision. The risk of AMD increases with age. AMD affects 1-2 out of 100 persons aged over 50.
        name3: There are Dry types and Wet types of macular degeneration.
        name4: Dry macular degeneration
        text1: In Hong Kong, 90% of macular degeneration patients are dry type. There is degeneration of retinal pigment epithelial cells in the macular area and formation of accumulated metabolic waste. These form drusen (yellow deposits) under the retina, which eventually leads to atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium.
        text2: Most patients have no obvious symptoms in the early stage. As more photoreceptor cells are being damaged, one's vision gradually gets blurred. However, there is a chance that dry macular degeneration can become wet macular degeneration, which can lead to sudden and severe vision loss. Up to now, there is no cure for dry macular degeneration. Regular follow-up of the disease is required early intervention when needed.
        name5: Wet macular degeneration
        text3: There are 10% of macular degenerations are wet AMD. Patients have abnormal blood vessels under the macula. If these blood vessels have leakage (fluid or blood), they can cause subretinal bleeding and subsequent scarring, which cause permanent damage to the retina.
        text4: The deterioration of wet AMD can be rapid, and it can lead to central visual field defect. If one of the eyes experiences sudden blurred or distorted vision, wet AMD would be suspected. On the other hand, the fellow eye is also needed to be checked because it may be in the early stage of wet macular degeneration or may carry the risk of suffering from the disease. Wet AMD can lead to severe visual loss in a short period of time, can be a few days. Therefore, you should contact an ophthalmologist immediately when suspected symptoms happen.

        title1: Laser photocoagulation
        text1: Laser photocoagulation uses high-energy laser to destroy area with abnormal blood vessels of the retina. However, the laser would also cause damage to the retinal tissue above the vessels (this will lead to immediate vision impairment or blindness) and thus cannot be applied to the lesions which are close to the center of the macula. It is therefore only suitable for specific type of AMD patients and is not commonly used to treat AMD in clinical practice.
        title2: Photodynamic therapy
        text2: Doctor injects a dye called Verteporfin into the vein and the medicine will circulate to the abnormal blood vessels under the retina and then accumulate in the specific area. A special laser is then shone onto the area after saturated, the laser activates the Verteporfin and lead to blockage of the abnormal blood vessels without affecting other surrounding tissues in the retina. By blocking the leaky blood vessels, photodynamic therapy helps to improve macular edema or subretinal hemorrhage and hope to improve vision. It is proved to be a effective method to treat Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV) which regards to be a special subtype of wet AMD. However, this therapy cannot restore destroyed vision function.
        title3: Intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide "IV TA" injection
        text3: Triamcinolone acetonide is a mineralocorticoid that can reduce the swelling and leakage of blood vessels at the macula and thus reduce edema. IV TA is commonly given along with other Anti-VEGF drugs in some cases. Intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide "IV TA" injections are given under topical anaesthesia in a sterile setting.
        title4: Intravitreal Anti-VEGF Injection

        name: FAQ
        q1: Q：Will phone in the dark increase the risk of macular degeneration?
        a1: Prolonged blue light exposure is reported to be harmful to the macula. Our pupil will be more dilated in dark and therefore theoretically we may intake more blue light from the screens in the dark. Some studies have shown that prolonged exposure to high-energy visible light can cause damage to the macula, which is similar to macular degeneration.
        q2: Q：Older people are more likely to have macular degeneration?
        a2: The older you are, the higher risk of developing age-related macular degeneration you have. However, these are other risk factors we also need to pay attention to, such as smoking, eating lots of high saturated fat or cholesterol food, excessive sun exposure, having vascular disease or high blood pressure, already having macular degeneration in one eye or genetic factors.
        q3: Q：What's the difference between dry and wet macular degeneration?
        a3: Patients suffering from dry macular degeneration have no obvious symptoms in the early stage and deterioration in vision is relatively slow. Drusen or geographic atrophy can be seen in the patient's fundus. But it may develop into wet subtype during its natural disease course. Wet AMD tends to be more severe in term of the visual damage. It has abnormal growth of vessels which lead to leakage beneath macula and the leakage may affect vision significantly. Exudation, edema, or hemorrhage can be seen during eye examination. If wet macular degeneration is not treated properly, photoreceptor cells can be damaged and permanent loss of center vision can be caused.
        q4: Q：Can injections treat macular degeneration?
        a4: Yes, injection of drugs (anti-VFGF or steroids, etc.) into the vitreous cavity is one of the effective treatments for macular degeneration. Medical reports show that this method has a good efficacy on treating the macular edema caused by wet AMD and it also has a role to promote visual improvement. Timely treatment is important, the earlier the macular degeneration is treated, the better result one may have. Injection of medicine can also be given along with PDT or other treatment (named as combined treatment in clinical practice) to obtain better treatment outcomes. For further details, you should discuss with your eye doctor so as to come up with a tailor-made treatment regimen for you.

      strabismus:
        name: What is strabismus?
        p1: When a distant object is viewed with both eyes, the visual axes—a line connecting the center of the cornea with the fovea—are parallel or almost so, and each fovea receives an image of the object. Strabismus is misalignment of the eyes, causing one eye to deviate inward (esotropia) toward the nose, or outward (exotropia), while the other eye remains focused. Strabismus leads to deviation of the affected eye from the normal visual axis frequently, our brain may suppress the image of the affected eye which results in poor vision development and amblyopia in the affected eye.
        p2: "What causes strabismus? Congenital diseases like: congenital diseases of brain and cranial nerves; or acquired disease: eyes or eye muscles injury; or severe refractive error (e.g. farsightedness) can cause strabismus in children."
      kind: 
        name: Types of Strabismus
        name1: Inwards/Outwards squint
        context1: Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned. Esotropia means that one eye is deviated inward. Exotropia is when one or both eyes look outward.
        text1_1: Normal
        text1_2: Inwards squint
        text1_3: Outwards squint
        name2: Upwards/Downwards squint
        context2: When the squint eye turns upwards is called hypertropia, whereby the visual axis of one eye is higher than the fellow fixating eye. Hypotropia is the similar condition, the squint eye turns downwards, focus being on the eye with the visual axis lower than the fellow fixating eye.
        text2_1: Normal
        text2_2: Upwards squint
        text2_3: Downwards squint
        name3: How to determine if a child is a true and false strabismus?
        context3: Strabismus can be false. "False" strabismus refers to a condition where one or both eyes appear misaligned but really, they are straight. Infants and young children are more likely to have "false" strabismus (commonly known as "false crossed-eyes").
        text3_1: Normal
        text3_2: False strabismus
        text3_3: True strabismus
        context4: This condition is often due to the fact that babies have a broad flat nasal bridge with small folds of eyelid skin at the inner corner of the eyelids.  These features make the eyes look crossed when in fact they are not. This will lead to a false appearance of strabismus. However, when the fold of skin near to the nose bridge is pinched with fingers, the optical illusion will disappear. As the child grows up, the false strabismus gradually disappears.
        name5: How to recognize strabismus?
        context5: "A child's daily behavior may also reflect strabismus:"

        text5_6: Watery eyes
      cure: 
        name: Treatment of strabismus
        title1: Correction with glasses
        text1: Mild strabismus can be corrected by glasses. Many patients with strabismus also have refractive error which includes myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism. People with hyperopia are more susceptible to develop esotropia while people with myopia are more susceptible to develop exotropia. For some patients with esotropia, the glasses may be able to provide full correction of the inward squint.
        title2: Orthoptic exercises
        text2: There are many types of orthoptic exercises. Patients with exotropia can do convergence exercise while esotropia can do exercise to relax the eye muscles. Orthoptic exercise can train the binocular vision in order to help patients with strabismus to rebuild their fusional ability and also improve their '3D' vision (stereopsis).
        title3: Occlusion therapy
        text3: Since many patients with strabismus also have amblyopia, they need to adopt occlusion therapy to patch the eye that has better vision in order to force the amblyopic eye to watch and to improve its visual function. Sometimes, even in the absence of amblyopia, alternate patching might help some patients with intermittent exotropia to improve the ability to control their squint. The time of daily occlusion and the duration of treatment depends on the age of the patient and the severity of amblyopia. When the vision of the lazy eye improves, occlusion treatment can be stopped under the advice of an ophthalmologist.
        title4: Surgery
        text4: Surgery is generally the last step in the treatment of strabismus. By changing the tightness of the eye muscles, the visual axis of both eyes can be restored to be balanced, so as to treat strabismus. The timing of surgery involves many considerations and varies from different patients. Patients should consult an ophthalmologist before undergoing surgery.
      amblyopia:
        name: What is Amblyopia?
        context1: Amblyopia is reduced vision in one eye caused by abnormal visual development early in life. Babies' vision is not normal at birth, visual functions develop gradually in their childhood. The first 3 years after birth is the most important period for visual development. If amblyopia is not treated promptly, patients would not be able to develop normal vision, their vision cannot be corrected by glasses or surgery.
        name1: Types of amblyopia
        title1: Strabismic amblyopia
        text1: Strabismic amblyopia is commonly seen in children under 4 years old who have or have had strabismus before. The patient's eyes are misaligned and their brain will suppress the images from the affected eye and lead to amblyopia.
        title2: Refractive amblyopia(Anisometric amblyopia)
        text2: There is a significant difference of refraction between two eyes and therefore the size and clarity of retinal images are different. Patient with a diopter difference of more than 300 degrees between two eyes may have amblyopia and strabismus in the eye with higher diopter.
        title3: Amblyopia due to refractive error
        text3: It is commonly found in children or adults with high myopia, farsightedness and astigmatism without corrective glasses. Most of them have myopia of more than 600 degrees, farsightedness of more than 500 degrees, and astigmatism greater than or equal to 200 degrees.
        title4: Deprivation amblyopia
        text4: Ptosis, corneal opacity, and congenital cataract will block the light entering the eyes, so that the light cannot stimulate the eyeball, hinder or block the macula from receiving visual stimulation, resulting in amblyopia.
        title5: Congenital amblyopia
        text5: The cause of this eye condition is still unclear. It may be caused by retinal hemorrhage or optic nerve defects. The development of the visual function is affected. Some cases develop amblyopia because of nystagmus and achromatopsia. 
      treat: 
        name: Treatment of amblyopia
        p1: The earlier amblyopia is treated, the better outcomes there may be. Three to six years of age is a critical period for treatment, and the chance of cure is lower after 12 years of age. The cure rate is up to 80% if treated before the age of 6, while it is only about 50% for patients who start treatment at 6-12 years of age.
        p2: Ophthalmologists need to customize a treatment plan for each child, and it needs to be adjusted according to the patient's progress.
        title1: Correction with glasses
        text1: Mild amblyopia can be corrected by glasses. A proper pair of glasses allow both eyes to see things together and improve binocular vision. To ensure the treatment is effective, the child should always wear the glasses.
        title2: Occlusion therapy (Eye Patching)
        text2_1: By patching the good eye, the amblyopic eye is forced to watch so as to improve its vision. The duration of the treatment depends on the severity of the amblyopia, age, and the cooperation between the child and the parent. During the treatment period, the child needs to have regular follow-up visits. An ophthalmologist will check the vision of the good eye and the amblyopic eye, and adjust the time of occlusion. If the treatment is effective, the time of patching eyes will be gradually reduced until the amblyopic eye develops normal vision.
        text2_2: Eye patching is effective in treating amblyopia and it was suggested to start before the 8. The earlier the treatment starts, the better the effect would be. If amblyopia is diagnosed at 8 years old or later, the chance of full recovery is lower.
        title3: Correction with eye drops
        text3: If children are not willing or able to cover their eyes, due to discomfort or sensitive skin. Eye drops to blur the near vision of the good eye will be recommended, thereby encouraging children to use more amblyopic eyes.
      curativeTime:
        name: Treat strabismus and amblyopia timely!
        context: Patients should arrange an eye examination for their children regularly to find out the cause of eye problems as soon as possible. The earlier detection and treatment, the better the effect. The effect of treatment also requires the cooperation of parents and children.

    amotioRetinae: Retinal Detachment
    amotioRetinae_head: 'Retinal Detachment｜CMER｜Medical Services'
    amotioRetinae_con: 
      title: retinal detachment
      intro: 
        name: What is Retinal Detachment?
        p1: The retina is a transparent, thin layer (less than 0.5mm in thickness) of tissue that lines the back of the eye. The central portion of the retina is called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. The retina acts like the film of a camera, it receives light that enters the eye, converts the light into neural signals, and sends these signals through the optic nerve to the brain for visual recognition. It is a sophisticated and fragile tissue and it is responsible for detecting qualities such as color and light-intensity. The retina is structured of ten layers, including nine layers of nerve cells and photoreceptors, one pigmented layer. The first nine-layers are called neurosensory retina and the tenth layer is called retinal pigment epithelium. One side of the retina is attached with the vitreous and the other side with the choroid.
        p2: Due to the retina’s vital role in vision, damage to it can cause permanent blindness. Conditions such as retinal detachment, where the retina is abnormally detached from its usual position, can disturb the retina from receiving or processing light. Therefore, the brain cannot receive visual information, thus leads to blindness. 
        p3: Retinal detachment is a serious ophthalmic emergency
        p4: ",which generally refers to the separation of the neurosensory retina (NSR) from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The RPE provides nutrition and oxygen for the NSR. Once the NSR is detached from the RPE, there can be significant loss of photoreceptor cells of the NSR that lead to visual damage, which may be irreversible."

        title1: Pneumatic retinopexy
        text1: An expanding gas bubble is injected into the eye, your doctor will position you so that the bubble floats over the detached area and pushes it against the back of your eye. Additional cryosurgery or laser therapy to seal the retina against the wall of the eye may also be needed.
        title2: Scleral buckle
        text2: Scleral buckling is a surgical procedure used to repair a retinal detachment. The scleral is the outer supporting layer of the eyeball. In this surgery, a surgeon attaches a piece of silicone or a sponge onto the outer part of the eye at the spot of a retinal tear/detachment, repairing the detachment by pushing the sclera toward the retinal tear or break. This is a surgery involving the outer part of the eye and therefore the risk of intraocular infection is considered to be less.
        title3: Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV)
        text3: Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is a minimally invasive procedure done with special tools inserted through three incisions (less than 1mm) the pars plana, an area in the white of the eye (sclera), to remove vitreous humor and re-attach the retina by injecting expanding gas or silicon oil. Other treatments (when needed) will be done at the same time, such as laser, membrane peeling or injection of anti-VFGF etc.
      diabetes:
        name: Diabetic Retinopathy
        p1: Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the retina (high blood sugar damages the endothelial cells of blood vessels). It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. Although it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten the eyesight, regular eye check is necessary for diabetic patients due to lack of symptom(s) in the early stage. Basically, all type 1 diabetes patients are affected by retinopathy in about 15 to 20 years after the onset of the disease. About 2-30% of type 1 diabetes patients are under the risk of vision loss while more than 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes have retinopathy in their disease course.
        p2: The retina is the light-sensitive layer that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain which turns them into the images we see. The retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels. Over time, a persistently high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels and retina, this damage can be permanent if not treated timely. Diabetic retinopathy includes blot hemorrhages, microaneurysms, hard exudates, diabetic macular edema, abnormal blood vessel growth in retina, retinal detachment, or secondary glaucoma. Permanent visual damage or even blindness can happen in severe cases.

        name: Prevention of Retinal Detachment
        context: "Literally, one can’t prevent retinal detachment, but one can take steps to lower the risks:"
        title1: Regular Eye Check
        text1: If you have nearsightedness (myopia, especially high myopia), eye exams are important. Myopia makes you more prone to retinal detachment. Your eye care provider should include dilated exams to find small retinal tears.
        title2: Stay Safe
        text2: Use safety goggles or other protection for your eyes when playing sports or doing other risky activities (e.g. roller coasters, bumper cars, diving, skydiving, bungee jumping).
        title3: Get Prompt Treatment
        text3: If you notice detached retina symptoms (seeing a lot of floaters and flashes suddenly), consult your eye doctor right away for a comprehensive eye examination.
        span1: Any age can experience retinal detachment, and people at high risk should undergo regular comprehensive eye examinations.
        span2: If you see a lot of floaters and flashes suddenly, you should go to your eye doctor immediately.
      faq: 
        name: FAQ
        q1: Q：Do floaters cause retinal detachment?
        a1: The vitreous shrinks as we age, becomes liquified and gradually forms different shapes of dark spots or shadows floating in the field of vision, just like the mosquitoes are flying in front of our eyes. If there is a sudden onset of increased floaters, please go see your eye doctor, it is probably the signs of retinal detachment.
        q2: Q：Does rubbing eyes lead to retinal detachment?
        a2: The force introduced to the eye when rubbing could be dangerous to those with high myopia which might cause retinal break or tear in them. The eyeball of a high myopia patient is elongated and the retina is very thin which may have pre-existed some degeneration and make them at risk of retinal detachment.
        q3: Q：Does retinal detachment need surgery for treatment?
        a3: "Retinal detachment is a visual-threatening emergency that requires prompt treatment. Treatments mainly include laser or surgery: if the retinal detachment is small and located peripherally, lasers can help to repair; if the retinal detachment is large in size, surgery might be the only option."
        q4: Q：Will retinal detachment recur?
        a4: "Retinal detachment has the risk of recurrence. Patients with a previous history of eye injury and diabetes have higher risks. It is recommended that a high-risk person should develop good eye health, such as: do not look at electronic screens or read at a close distance for a long time; use electronic products in sufficient light environments; have enough rest and have regular eye check."

      pterygium: 
        title: Pterygium
        context: A pterygium is a triangular fibrovascular growth on the cornea of the eye. It is generally developed from bulbar conjunctiva. A new enlarging tissue from the conjunctiva slowly grows over the cornea and is shaped like a wedge. Pterygium will grow larger gradually. In serious case, it may change the corneal curvature and result in astigmatism; or the pterygium may grow too large (> 3mm) and block the pupil that affects patient’s visual function. Pterygium occurs more common in tropical regions, which is associated with excessive exposure to sunlight.
        name: Causes of pterygium
        span1: Genetic factors
        span2: Nutritional deficiencies, insufficient tear secretion

        text1: Pterygium is generally small in size and does not lead to any effects. Sometimes patients will experience eye redness, itchiness, burning sensation or have appearance problem.
        text2: Larger pterygium can change the corneal curvature and result in astigmatism and blurred vision. Some pterygia may spread to the central cornea and lead to vision loss.
        name3: Pterygium treatments
        text3_1: The treatment to prevent progression of pterygium is to avoid chronic irritation. Treatment is not required if pterygium is small and does not further grow.
        text3_2: If apparent symptoms or severe hyperemia is experienced, patients can use corticosteroids under medical supervision to reduce inflammation.
        text3_3: If eyesight is affected or pterygium becomes larger, pterygium removal can be considered.
        text3_4: In some cases, a pterygium can return after being surgically removed. The ways to lower the recurrence rate include conjunctival autograft and anti-metabolite drugs.
      blepharitis:

        text4_1: This is the most common type of episcleritis which mostly found in females. Patients will have symptoms such as eye redness and eye pain. The scleral surface will form a lump of hyperemic, bulbar conjunctiva will have diffuse congestion and edema which is in purple-reddish colour (as seen in the figure). Its symptoms are generally mild with minimal discomfort and burning sensation. Visual function is not affected. Sphincter pupillae muscle and ciliary muscle spasm will appear sometimes and lead to miosis and temporary myopia. The onset of this episcleritis is periodic and acute. It lasts from one to several days each time and some patients may have it again every one to three months.
        span4_1: Patients with simple episcleritis have localized eye redness and usually do not affect their cornea. It is different from epidemic keratoconjunctivitis that has diffused eye redness.
        name4_2: Nodular Episcleritis
        text4_2: Comparing to simple episcleritis, nodular episcleritis usually develops in young females and the recovery period is longer. Patients may have symptoms of eye redness, eye pain, sensitive to light and tearing, but visual function is generally not affected. It usually lasts for around 2 weeks and inflammation will fade gradually. Around two third of patients will have nodular episcleritis again for several times.
        span4_2: The typical feature of nodular episcleritis is having a single nodule. It is surrounded by conjunctival hyperemia and edema.

      ophthalmoplasty:
        title: Eye plastic surgery
        p: Eye plastic surgery and orbital surgery are advanced treatments for patients with congenital and acquired defects of their eyelids, eye sockets, eyes and lacrimal glands, so that the natural appearance of their eyes and face will be recovered. Our centre provides rehabilitation services for eye injuries and ocular diseases.
        name: Types of eyelid malposition
        name1_1: Ptosis
        p1_1: Ptosis may appear due to congenital or acquired factors. It is usually developed due to weakness or disinsertion of levator muscle. For most congenital cases, it is caused by dysgenesis of levator muscle.
        p1_2: If children with ptosis can be treated in the early stage, it can prevent the development of amblyopia or lazy eye. In rare cases, ptosis may be related to Blepharophimosis syndrome. Ophthalmologists diagnose the type of ptosis and decides about appropriate surgical procedure suitable for the patient.
        name1_2: Ptosis treatment
        p1_3: The treatment options are Müllerectomy (MMCR), Levator muscle resection or plication, Levator aponeurosis repair and Tarso-frontal sling surgery. These are minimally invasive procedures with good cosmetic outcomes.
        name2_1: Entropion
        p2_1: Entropion is an inward turning of the eyelid margin. This is commonly seen in elderly patients. It is usually caused by eyelid muscle abnormalities, conjunctival secondary trauma (by chemicals, burns or machines), infection or inflammatory diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome. And can be due to age-related degeneration of eyelid tissue.
        p2_2: As a result of eyelash trauma to the cornea, there could be corneal damage which can lead to visual loss. The position of eyelid margin and eyelashes can be corrected by surgery.
        name2_2: Entropion treatment
        p2_3: There are several procedures such as jones, Quickert’s, Weiss procedure and lateral canthopexy. Mucosal graft is reserved for cases with severe scarring of the conjunctiva.
        name3_1: Ectropion
        p3_1: Ectropion is an outward turning of the eyelid margin. It is a condition usually caused by loose eyelid when eye structure change in elderly after menopause. Besides, scars on eyelids, facial nerve palsy and loose eyelids will also lead to ectropion. Congenital ectropion is rare.
        name3_2: Ectropion treatment
        p3_2: The purpose of the surgery is to fix the eyelid position back to normal. Treatment methods will depend on the causes of the malposition, they will be chosen from eyelid tightening to skin graft. Ophthalmologists will advise the most suitable treatment options to patients through clinical diagnosis.
        name4_1: Lagophthalmus
        p4_1: Patients with lagophthalmos cannot completely close their eyelids. Lagophthalmos is commonly seen in cases of congenital ptosis, facial palsy and eyelid skin scarring. Improper closure of eyelids can lead to dry eyes or corneal ulceration.
        name4_2: Treatments of lagophthalmos
        p4_2: The main objective is to prevent damage to cornea. It can be treated by taping the eyelids at night and copious amount of lubricants.

        title5_1: Eyelid disorders/ Eyelid laceration
        text5_1: Eyelid disorders/ Eyelid laceration is formed by eyelid tear, trauma or lump excision on eyelid; It can be congenital eyelid disorders/ eyelid laceration. Surgery can help eyelids to keep natural appearance. There are several reconstructive techniques to repair the eyelids.
        title5_2: Exophthalmos
        text5_2_1: Bulging eyes are also known as exophthalmos or proptosis which can be unilateral or bilateral. The common association with exophthalmos is thyroid eye disease. The other causes could be orbital tumor, high myopia, and orbital inflammation/ infections. The management is generally based on the cause of exophthalmos.
        text5_2_2: In serious case, it may influence visual function as optic nerve is compressed or lead to damage and ulcer due to exposure of cornea. Eyelid can be treated through surgeries with a tiny incision.
        title5_3: Watery eyes
        text5_3_1: Blocked tear duct is one of the reasons for watery eyes. It is called as Primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO). For some patients, it can present since birth which is known as congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO). The initial treatment of CNLDO is lacrimal sac massage which is very effective in first year of life. Syringing and probing is needed in cases of failed conservative treatment. For adults, OANDO is the main cause of watery eyes and secondary causes could be post-trauma, tumor of lacrimal sac, dacryoliths, and chronic rhinosinusitis etc.
        text5_3_2: The treatment would be surgical, where the blocked tear duct is bypassed by creating an opening into the nasal cavity adjacent to the lacrimal sac.
        title5_4: Socket reconstruction
        text5_4: The common reasons for eyeball removal are tumor, intraocular infection, painful blind eye and intraocular infection. Enucleation includes removal of eyeball and other parts inside the eye (eye muscles and eye sockets will remain intact). The prosthetic eyes are customized according to the shape of socket. The colour and appearance are matched with the normal eye of the patient.
        title5_5: Contracted socket
        text5_5: It is a condition where there is shrinkage of the orbital tissue and volume which causes inability to retain the prosthesis. It could be due to multiple surgeries in the socket, absence of primary orbital implant after eye removal surgery, chemical or radiation injuries etc. The cosmetic correction can be done by deepening the fornixes and volume replacement by secondary orbital implant or a dermis fat graft. The prosthesis can be worn after the reconstruction surgery.
        name6: Eye Bag Removal
        text6: The causes of under-eye bags include genetics, natural aging and lifestyle, chief among which is aging. With the aging process, the tissues and muscles around the eyes begin to weaken and lose tension. This weakening allows the fat surrounding the eye to bulge out and therefore, contribute to the baggy appearance.
        name7: Eye Bag Removal Treatments
        title7_1: Internal Incision：
        text7_1_1: Performed by creating an incision inside the eyelid through the conjunctiva to remove excess fat. No visible skin incisions or scarring will be formed after the procedure. This method is suitable for people who are relatively young and have tight lower eyelid skin.
        text7_1_2: ""
        title7_2: External incision：
        text7_2: Performed by creating an incision on the lower eyelid beneath the eye lashes (around 1-2mm) to remove excess fat and tissue. This method can reposition the excess fat to fill in the tear trough. The incision will be sutured and is less noticeable after healing is complete. This method is suitable for people with more severe aging changes, larger eye bags and sagging of eyelids.
        name8: Double Eyelid Surgery
        text8: A double eyelid (crease) forms when the levator muscle extends and attaches to the pretarsal skin. The majority of Asians have single eyelid creases due to thicker eyelid skin, excess fatty tissue and the levator muscle extending to the lower part (the position near to eyelashes) of the eyelid. Thus, double eyelid surgery can be performed to create artificial attachments between the upper eyelid muscle and the overlying upper eyelid skin.

In general, the epicanthic fold does not affect vision and appearance, however, it may block the vision, shorten palpebral fissure length (eye length) and widen the distance between eyes in severe cases.
        text10_2: In addition, the presence of epicanthic fold is one of the major factors that affect the result of double eyelid surgery, as the epicanthic fold may cover the formed crease at the inner corner of the eye. Thus, an epicanthoplasty is often performed in combination with double eyelid surgery. By eliminating the excess upper eyelid fold, the inner angle of the eye will be more visible, and therefore, the distance between eyes will be reduced.

        p1: These tumours can arise from eyelids, conjunctiva, or within the eyeball and periocular tissue. Ocular tumours are also known as eye cancers, which may cause damage to eye tissues and eye functions no matter it is benign or malignant tumour. Malignant tumours have a tendency to spread outside the eyeball, orbit, brain and to whole body. Meanwhile, malignment tumours from other part of body can also reach the eye tissue through blood stream. The normal protrusion degree of both eyeballs is the same, around one third people have 0.5 – 2mm difference while 1% people may have 2mm difference.

        p2_1: The protrusion degree is more than 22mm and the difference of both eyes is greater than 2mm or the degree keeps increasing during the observation period. These are known as pathological bulging eyes. The reasons that lead to eye protruding include tumours, inflammation in eye sockets, Graves disease, vascular malformations and orbital trauma.
        name2_2: "Prolapse of the Eye:"
        p2_2: Orbital pressure increases due to trauma and tumours, so the eyeball protrudes outside eyelids. If eyeballs protrude a lot and with the symptom of eyelid twitch, it will be easy to have prolapse of the eye.

        name3_1: Eyelid cancer
        text3_1: Keratoacanthoma
        text3_2: Squamous cell epithelioma
        p3_1: Keratoacanthoma and squamous cell epithelioma are both related to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays. Since the distribution of skin pigmentation is different, the risk for Asians to have eye cancer is lower than white people. Squamous cell epithelioma is also related to HIV infection.
        p3_2: The typical appearance of both cancers is swollen bump that newly appears on eyelids. The bump grows fast and may develop ulceration. Sometimes it is hard to differentiate, so the tissue may need to be cut and examine in order to confirm the diagnosis and grading. Once it is confirmed, they can be treated by local chemotherapy, radiotherapy and cryotherapy based on the grading.
        name4: Ocular surface cancer
        text4_1: Pterygium
        text4_2: Squamous cell carcinoma on ocular surface
        p4_1: Both are closely related to gradual damage from ultraviolet rays. Pterygium is a benign chronic degeneration, the typical symptoms are the conjunctiva on the sclera becoming thicker and will become fleshy. The symptoms are not apparent in the early stage. Squamous cell carcinoma is also related to exposure to ultraviolet rays. It is usually not easy to be distinguished with pterygium. However, squamous cell carcinoma can invade the ocular structures and spread through blood vessels and lymphatics, so it must be treated seriously.
        p4_2: The general development of pterygium is slow, but usually in stationary phase. If there is no symptom or the size is smaller than 3mm, it is not needed to be treated, but observation; If it becomes active or the size is larger than 3mm, it is needed to consider receiving treatment. Generally all pterygium does not need excision or treatment. However, it may cause discomfort to eyes and need to apply eye drops to relieve inflammation and discomfort if pterygium grows larger. If pterygium becomes larger and grows to the central area of cornea, lead to astigmatism and even cover pupils, it may damage visual function, so pterygium removal should be considered. The treatment is safe and effective. Pterygium removal can improve both appearance and astigmatism. For squamous cell carcinoma, it should be removed and sent for histopathological examination to look for margins and base clearance in order to decide further treatment.
        name5: Intraocular cancer
        text5_1: Melanocytic tumor
        text5_2: Melanoma
        p5: Both are degradations inside the eyes. There are usually no symptoms in the early stage. However, when it has progressed to the stage that affects visual function, the size of the swollen lump should be quite apparent.Melanocytic tumor is rarer to be seen. Its typical symptom is to grow black swollen bump in retina and it is usually found in one eye; it is more common to be seen among dark skinned people and females. Melanocytic tumor is often to be grown in optic nerve. This tumour is usually benign, so generally treatment is not needed. However, this tumour can rarely have malignant transformation which requires treatment. If the tumour becomes malignant, radiation therapy or removal surgery should be considered.Melanoma is malignant which will grow inside the eye, invade retina and vitreous. The malignant tumour cell may even spread to whole body and affect important organs. If melanoma is diagnosed, early treatment is required, so visual function can be retained and the possibility to spread to whole body can be reduced.
        text5_3: Coats' disease
        text5_4: Retinoblastoma
        p5_1: Both diseases are common to be seen among children. Parents usually identify them because their children have strabismus and white pupil. Coats' disease is also known as exudative retinitis or retinal telangiectasis. It can lead to decreases in visual acuity and even blindness. Coats' disease usually affects one eye and attacks before 10 years old. Its symptoms include abnormal expansion and growth of capillaries in retina. These will cause a series of symptoms as blood exudates to retina. Radiation therapy or cryotherapy can be considered in the early stage. These therapies can damage the abnormal capillaries in retina in order to prevent the disease from getting worse.
        p5_2: Retinoblastoma is most found primary eye tumour among children. It is a malignant tumour grown from the retina. If retinoblastoma is not treated, it will quickly grow towards the retina and may spread to areas outside of the eyeball, follow the optic nerve and transfer to the brain or the whole body. However, treatment should be chosen according to patient’s situation and other conditions such as unilateral or bilateral tumour, residual visual function, the position of the tumour and if it is already spread to optic nerve, the brain or haematogenous spread.

        title6: Treatments of eye tumour
        name6_1: Laser treatment
        text6_1: Laser treatment has good efficacy for tumour that is small in size. It is usually performed through general anaesthesia and there will be no incision. Regular follow-ups are required until tumour is under control. A further laser treatment maybe performed if needed.
        name6_2: Cold therapy
        text6_2: Cold therapy is same as laser treatment which has good efficacy for tumour in smaller size. However, this treatment needs to cut the conjunctiva and perform the treatment outside of the patient’s sclera. Ophthalmologist will use an indirect ophthalmoscope to fix the position and the freezing device will be placed on the sclera where the tumour is. This therapy aims at destroying the tumour by freezing it. There will be a wound on the conjunctiva after the treatment. Eyelid and the eye will be swollen. This will be disappeared in around 1 to 5 days.
        name6_3: Radiation therapy
        text6_3: Radiation therapy is used for treating local tumour. This therapy can also keep the visual function of treated eye. Retinoblastoma is very sensitive to radiation. However, radiation therapy brought a lot of side effects and complications in the past, so it is not commonly used by ophthalmologists. Nowadays, the radiation technique can destroy local tumour effectively.
        name6_4: Chemotherapy
        text6_4: The regular way of chemical therapy is systemic treatment. The chemical will reach the tumour cell through blood circulation after intravenous Injection in order to lower the growth of tumour.

        span3: It should be tailor made by ocularists with lots of experience according to patient’s eye socket size, appearance and colour of the healthy eye. It is made after accurate calculation. Generally, tailor made eye prosthetic needs to be ordered one day before. Individuals may need extra follow-ups for prosthesis adjustment. If there is no special situation after the implantation, follow-ups generally will be arranged every half year to one year. Since the size of eye socket and the facial shape of children are not mature after the enucleation, their eye prosthesis is needed to be replaced regularly. Therefore, follow-ups are important for them. For adult patients, they require to have adjustment around every 4 to 5 years.
        name4: Important note for ocular prosthesis
        text4: Ocular prosthesis can create a more natural appearance and fill the eye socket. It can be used for longer time if the ocular prosthesis has often and essential/ necessary care treatment.
